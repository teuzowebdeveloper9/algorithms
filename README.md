This repository contains implementations of various algorithms as I learn and understand them from the book "Understanding Algorithms".

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

      )

### 2. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

     )

### 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## How to Use
To use these algorithms, you can clone the repository and run the individual scripts. Each algorithm is implemented in its own script for clarity and ease of use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teuzowebdeveloper9/algorithms.git
cd algorithms
